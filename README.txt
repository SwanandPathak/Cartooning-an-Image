CV-631 PA-1 Cartoon Image Formation.

To run the Code Follow the Following steps:-
1. Add the correct path to the image you would like to test in line '6' in the imread() Method
2. If the Image is Small (512*512 or smaller), Comment or remove the code in line '8' which resizes the image to 20% of its size. I have done this Since I was using the Hohenzollern Castle image to test my code.


The Code takes 20-30 secs to run for large inputs. Wait for the output for this time.
It is necessary to give a color image input to the code.(RGB)
Also the report has extended by a page, this is only because of the images present in it.
